# poolProblem

This is an java desktop app programmed by me and Muhammed Kurfeyiz.

Main idea is to solve the filling problem of a pool like which pipes the water will flow max and what is the minimum cut if we want to cut some pipes with reaching to end point.

Max flow and min cut algorithms were used to solve problem. 

IntelliJ, Netbeans and Screenbuilder have been used to write the codes.
